> Becoming an Open Source and free-for-all build tool with interfaces as well.

First of all, welcome to the project, it will test your patience and take up a lot of your time in creating a great magic tool.
Inspired by the RFC that uses UTF-8 as its encoding setting, know that we are trying to make a difference in our valuable computing world.

We want to change the "expenses" with development, with the time to complete the software being conclusive.

Speed up this creation or implementation and ensure the use of APIs.
